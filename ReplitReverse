# Replit App Reverse-Engineering Prompt

## Purpose
To extract all essential details from a completed Replit project and generate a **single, unified prompt** capable of recreating the identical application from scratch.

---

## Prompt Text

**Instruction:**  
Examine the completed Replit project and produce a single, unified prompt that contains all information needed to recreate the identical application from scratch.

Your output should merge every functional, contextual, and design detail into **one concise but complete instruction set** â€” as if it were the original prompt used to generate the app.

---

## The Reconstructed Prompt Must Include:

### 1. Purpose & Goals
- Describe **what** the app is meant to do.  
- Explain **why** the app exists and its intended outcome.

### 2. Functional Specifications
- All **features**, **workflows**, and **logic**.  
- Every **user interaction** and system behavior.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- UI/UX style and tone.  
- Performance constraints.  
- Accessibility requirements.  
- Other qualitative guidelines.

### 4. Platform & Environment
- Where the app runs (e.g., Replit, web, mobile).  
- Language(s) and/or framework(s) used.  
- Dependencies and integrations.

### 5. Target Audience & Usage Context
- Who will use the app.  
- In what situations or environments it will be used.

### 6. Constraints & Boundaries
- Technical limitations.  
- Content rules.  
- Compliance or legal considerations.

## Output Requirement
The final result must be a **standalone, ready-to-use prompt** that an AI or developer could follow to recreate the app **exactly**, without needing any additional information.
