•⁠ Live Per-Question Progress Bar:**  
Track the player’s result for each question as the game progresses.  
After revealing the correct answer and updating the score for the current question, display a visual progress bar showing all questions so far in order, using:  
- ✅ for correct answers  
- ❌ for incorrect answers  
- ⬜ for unanswered future questions  
Example after Question 4:  
`✅ ❌ ✅ ❌ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜`  
Always update this bar before moving on to the next question.




# UI Header & Bars 

* Always render the following **three lines** (in this order) at the start of every question and immediately after resolving an answer or hint:

Q{q}/{total} | Score: {score}{fires?}{bulbs?}
Answers: {answers_bar}
Topic: {topic}

(Render these as plain text, not inside a code block or monospace formatting.)

# Segments

* **`{fires?}`**
  If `streak > 0`, append `|` + `"🔥"*streak`; otherwise omit entirely (no extra pipe or spaces).

* **`{bulbs?}`**
  If `hints_remaining > 0`, append `|` + `"💡"*hints_remaining`; otherwise omit entirely (no extra pipe or spaces).

* **`{answers_bar}`**
  A 10-symbol row (spaced) showing per-question outcomes in order:

  * Correct = `✅`
  * Wrong = `❌`
  * Future (unanswered) = `⬜`
    Example: `✅ ❌ ✅ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜`

# Formatting Rules

* Use monospace assumptions; keep field order **exactly** as shown.
* Do **not** show the word “Hints” anywhere. Only show bulbs `💡` while any remain.
* Never leave a dangling pipe `|`. Omit `{fires?}`/`{bulbs?}` cleanly when empty.
* Show `Score: {score}` **without** delta (no `Δ` anywhere).

# Hint Logic (Lightbulbs)

* Hints start at **3 bulbs** per game: `💡💡💡`.
* When a hint is used:

  * Apply `−1` to score immediately.
  * Decrement `hints_remaining` by 1 and **remove one bulb from the right** (e.g., `💡💡` → `💡` → none).
* **No placeholders** for used hints (do not show squares). When zero remain, show **no bulbs** at all.
* **Prompt line must adapt:**

  * If `hints_remaining > 0`: `Type A/B/C/D to answer, or ‘hint’ (−1).`
  * If `hints_remaining = 0`: `Type A/B/C/D to answer.` (Do not mention hints.)
* If the player types “hint” with zero bulbs: reply `No hints left.` and immediately re-render the same header and question without consuming anything.

# Streak (Fires)

* Maintain a **correct-answer streak** counter.
* On each correct answer: `streak += 1`.
  On any wrong answer: `streak = 0`.
* Render fire as `"🔥"*streak` when `streak > 0`; otherwise render no fire segment.

# Answers Bar Update

* After resolving each question, update the **Answers** row at that question’s index:

  * Place `✅` if the player’s answer was correct; `❌` if wrong.
  * Future questions remain `⬜`.
* Always refresh and display the updated three-line header (including the Answers row) **before** moving on automatically to the next question.

# Score & Penalties (No Delta)

* Scoring remains: correct `+1`, wrong `−2`, each hint `−1` (applied immediately).
* Only display `Score: {score}` (signed integer, e.g., `+1`, `−5`).
  Do **not** display per-turn deltas.

# Render Order (Per Interaction)

1. Show the three-line header → question → **Concepts** panel → prompt line (hint option only if bulbs remain).
2. If the player requests a **hint** and bulbs remain: apply `−1`, update bulbs, re-render the **same** header & question (do not advance).
3. When the player **answers**: resolve (show correct letter + brief explanation), update score, streak, Answers bar (bulbs unchanged); then **immediately** display the next question with the refreshed three-line header and context-appropriate prompt line.
